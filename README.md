# Awesome Speaker In Speech Field 
> Hi, everyone! Iâ€™m Junjie Li [[Homepage]](https://mrjunjieli.github.io/), currently a Ph.D. student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°.
This repository aims to help students become familiar with speaker-related tasks while also serving as a resource for my own learning and development. 


Summary of speaker related tasks, like speaker recognition, verification, diarization, spoofing, voice conversion, target speaker extraction and so on. 

## Book recommendations
* Understanding Deep learning [[pdf]](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)
* Computer vision: models learning and inference [[pdf]](https://udlbook.github.io/cvbook/)
